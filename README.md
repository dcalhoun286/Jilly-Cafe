# Jily Cafe

Authored by Roger Wells

JIly Cafe is a gelato and espresso cafe in the Motomachi area of Kobe. I’m building this website for them. Initially, the plan was to set up payments using Stripe, but a shift was made to Shopify. 

A Shopify shop will be created after I finish the designs for the front page in React. 

## Version 0.0.1

- Created background designs in Illustrator with a designer
- Created initial page layout

- Created clickable logo that opens menu on click
    - Decided to change to a classic hamburger menu button so that users can easily understand.
- Created side menu with icons using React Icons

    - Slide out using state loads the closing animation on page load
        - TODO: re-implement a closing animation for the menu
