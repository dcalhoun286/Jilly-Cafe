# Jily Cafe

Authored by Roger Wells

JIly Cafe is a gelato and espresso cafe in the Motomachi area of Kobe. I’m building this website for them. Initially, the plan was to set up payments using Stripe, but a shift was made to Shopify. 

A Shopify shop will be created after I finish the designs for the front page in React. 

## Version 0.0.1
